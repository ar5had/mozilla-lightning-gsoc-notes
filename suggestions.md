## Suggestions

* There are so many repositories with similar name and workspace and setup guide that someone new to gsoc or beginner will build a wrong repo.. Like I build mozilla central first then comm-central. Maybe create a mdn page where description of all repo is given and the version control they use. (nvm if there is already such page)

* There should be a suggestion to enable calendar in [Thunderbird Setup Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Simple_Thunderbird_build).

* There should be list of softwares(even better if commands for popular os can also be attached) that get installed in prequisite setup so that if prequisite setup fails due to some reason even then user can be able to follow manually. I did this manually, following through logs each time that which package is missing is really tiresome.

* A separate detailed page/link for mach commands, I think there exists a page but I didn't found `mach clobber` command there so maybe that page is missing some other commands as well. 

* Reading this [xul docs page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/Tutorial/Manifest_Files), manifest file should have `.manifest` extension but the manifest file in `comm-central` is `jar.mn`. If you read manifest files section, you might assume that manifest files are supposed to be located in `chrome` named directory.

*  There are so many things(sometimes version of things) with same name for e.g, manifest files format, chrome etc. which creates confusion atleast for a novice or beginner.
