## Important Points

* Prefer to message on mailing list or public group then personal message. 

* Concentrate on the process instead of the code. Link some of the best written code to your proposal and obviously best looking work as well.

* For the gsoc process, it would be good to see how you would do the planning. This includes identifying components that are easy to work upon and components having least dependencies.

* It also includes the timeframe, to see how long you believe you would take for each part of the project. The goal is not for you to do as much as possible in as little time as possible, but much more that the estimates are detailed and realistic

* So not just something like: Week 3-4: migrate Dialog X. Week 5-6: migrate Dialog Y, but rather going into details. You can count 1 point per half a work day in your estimates, so it would be someting like: create basic structure for dialog X: 2pt, move component X from XBL to react: 4pt.

* Tasks that are more than 5-6 points should be split up.. kind of like the scrum points system, if you have experience with that.

* If you want, you could of course also create a html rapid prototype for one dialog. This of course doesn't have to be fully functional nor styled perfectly, but it should show your skills creating react components and html. You are welcome to show your UX skills if you believe the dialog you are converting is not ideal, in this case it would be good to write.

* Write down your thoughts on what you are changing and why.

* Feel free to ask community and mentor's feedback at different stages while you are creating your application.
