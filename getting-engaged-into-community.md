## Getting engaged into community

Mozilla values open communication, which is why most ideas are discussed
via public mailing lists and irc channels. It would be most
valuable if most of the project communication would happen on the
mailing list `mozilla.dev.apps.yourproject`, which you can subscribe to via
NNTP using news.mozilla.org, or use the Google Groups mirror. The target
for this mailing list is primarily development questions, so for example
if you have some questions regarding certain calendar interfaces or
something is not working, I think that would be the best place to post.
Preferably, use more than one thread if you have different topics, to
avoid having one big thread for all things.

For the ad-hoc questions, it would be great if you could set up your
messaging client to connect to irc.mozilla.org on a regular basis, at
least while you are working on the project. Most org mentors use a bouncer to make sure
they are always connected.

Then there are the more high-level updates: it would be great if you could blog about your
work during the project at set intervals. This doesn't has to be
every week if there is no major progress, but getting updates out at
least once every two weeks would be great.

Try to join meetings and other session/chat to get engaged into community.
