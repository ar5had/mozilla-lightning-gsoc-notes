## resources



* for themes, here are the browser themes: https://dxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mozilla/toolkit/themes
themes - DXR
* if you can just include css from there instead of writing your own that would be best, but you may need to do some overrides
* I think the main include is https://dxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mozilla/toolkit/themes/linux/global/global.css
global.css - DXR

* so chrome://global/skin/global.css I believe
* then there is https://github.com/browserhtml/browserhtml which might be helpful to scavenge some css
* regarding redux, I'd suggest to go to #devtools and ask them what they are using for state management
